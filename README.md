# Big_data_routing_optimization
# AI-Powered Route Optimization with FastAPI, Kafka, and Spark

This project demonstrates real-time AI-powered route optimization using **FastAPI**, **Kafka**, and **Apache Spark**. The system uses real-time traffic and weather data to optimize routes for vehicles.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **Kafka**: A distributed streaming platform to handle real-time data.
- **Apache Spark**: A unified analytics engine for real-time data processing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Ingestion**: Continuously ingesting traffic and weather data from Kafka.
- **Route Optimization**: Optimizing routes based on traffic and weather conditions.
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Using **Spark Streaming** to process data in real-time.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
